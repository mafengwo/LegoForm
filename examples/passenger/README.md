# Examples
LegoForm is distributed with few examples in its [source code](https://github.com/mafengwo/LegoForm/tree/master/examples/).

## Passenger
This is the most basic form example, passengers who flight into one country need to fill a special form called Passenger Declaration Form.
Elements in this form are simple guys such as name, gender, hotel address, flight number etc.
The Passenger Form example emulate this situation and show you how LegoForm works.

git clone https://github.com/mafengwo/LegoForm.git
